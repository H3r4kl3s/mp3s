<h1 align="center">MP3S</h1>

<h2 align="center">mp3s is a Python Software -- thought to be used with mp3 files downloaded using youtube-dl --  that makes the files' names more user friendly and changes the metadata of the file. </h2>

**HOW TO USE**:

1. move the software to the directory where all the mp3 files are
2. run: ``` python3 mp3s.py artist album genre ```
<p>obs: arguments with more than 1 word, must have its words separated by "-". ex: new-york-dolls</p>

**EXAMPLES**:

```python3 mp3s.py Smashing-Pumpkins Siamese-Dream Rock ```<br>
```python3 mp3s.py The-Cure Disintegration Post-Punk```

**INTENT**:
<p>mp3s came from the of adding metadata to mp3 files, downloaded using youtube-dl and usually from a playlist. The software adds the band/artist tag, album tag and the genre tag. It also "cleans up" the name of the file, since files generated by youtube-dl usually come with a lot of "junk code" at the end of their name. It also tries to clean the name from stuff like "(Official Clip)". There may be some bugs, but we'll try to fix them.
